## Backend Assessment  

# Application

We would like you to create a java based backend application using REST.
It should contain the following endpoints;

  * GET /api/stocks (get a list of stocks)  
  * GET /api/stocks/1 (get one stock from the list)  
  * POST /api/stocks/1 (update the price of a single stock)  

The list of stocks should come from a memory database like h2.
The stock object contains at least the fields; id (Number), name (String), currentPrice (Amount) and lastUpdate (Timestamp).
Use the frameworks as you see fit to build and test this.

# Implementation  
Treat this application as a real MVP that should go to production.

# Merge request  
Provide us with a merge request to master of this repository.

# Duration
This assignment should take 4-5 hours at the most.

Good luck!
